24/03/2023 --> Fixed a minor bug in the diving algorithms (3_CYCLE_DIVE, 4_CYCLE_DIVE_IMP, 5_HYBRID, 7_HYBRID_ITA, 9_HYBRID_NET) that could occur when an LP model was infeasible. The bug does not impact the overall solving time and never occured in the instances tested in the paper, but could provoke a segmentation fault when solving (new) small sparse instances.
